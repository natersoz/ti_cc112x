    description: |
      Chip Status Byte
      When the header byte, data byte, or command strobe is sent on the SPI interface,
      the chip status byte is sent by the CC120X on the SO pin. The status byte contains
      key status signals, useful for the MCU.
      The first bit, S7, is the CHIP_RDYn signal.
      The CHIP_RDYn signal must go low before the first positive edge of SCLK.
      The CHIP_RDYn signal indicates that the crystal is stable.
      S6, S5, and S4 comprise the STATE value which reflects the state of the chip.
      In IDLE state the XOSC and power to the digital core are on and all other
      modules are in power down.
      Unless otherwise stated, registers should not be changed unless the chip is in IDLE state.

          IQIC image channel level threshold.
          Image rejection will be activated when image carrier is present.
          The IQIC image channel level threshold is an image carrier detector.
          High threshold imply that image carrier must be high to enable IQIC compensation module

# Command Strobes may be viewed as single byte instructions to CC120X.
# By addressing a command strobe register, internal sequences will be started.
# These commands are used to enable receive and transmit mode, enter SLEEP mode,
# disable the crystal oscillator, etc.
# The command strobe registers are accessed by transferring a single header byte
# (no data is transferred). i.e. only the R/W ̄ bit, the burst access bit (set to 0),
# and the six address bits (in the range 0x30 through 0x3D) are written.
# The status byte is available on the SO pin when a command strobe is being sent.
